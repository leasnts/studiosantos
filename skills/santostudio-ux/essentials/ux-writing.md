# UX Writing

Words that guide, delight, and feel human.

## Core Principle

**Every word is interface.** Text isn't decoration—it's a critical part of UX. Bad copy creates confusion, good copy creates trust and clarity.

## The Santos Studio Voice

### Tone Attributes

| Attribute | Not This | This |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Human** | "Your request has been processed" | "Done! Your changes are saved" |
| **Confident** | "We think this might work..." | "This will save you 2 hours" |
| **Concise** | "In order to proceed with..." | "To continue..." |
| **Warm** | "Error: Invalid input" | "Hmm, that doesn't look right" |
| **Clear** | "Utilize our platform" | "Use the app" |

### Adapt to Context

**Onboarding:** Warm, encouraging, exciting
```
"Let's get you set up—it only takes a minute ✨"
```

**Errors:** Calm, helpful, non-blaming
```
"That password didn't match. Want to try again?"
```

**Success:** Celebratory but brief
```
"You're all set! 🎉"
```

**Forms:** Clear, instructive, minimal
```
"Email" (not "Please enter your email address below")
```

## Writing Realistic Content

### Never Use Lorem Ipsum

Lorem ipsum tells you nothing about how real content will look and feel.

```
❌ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

✅ "Your weekly summary is ready. You completed 12 tasks 
    and saved approximately 3 hours this week."
```

### Match the User's Context

**Know your user.** Write content that sounds like something they'd actually see.

**B2B SaaS:**
```
"Your team completed 47 tasks this sprint"
"3 contracts pending signature"
"Revenue forecast updated"
```

**Consumer App:**
```
"You've got 3 new matches 💫"
"Your order arrives tomorrow"
"Streak: 7 days in a row!"
```

**E-commerce:**
```
"Only 2 left in stock"
"Free shipping on orders over €50"
"Sarah from Paris just bought this"
```

### Realistic Data Examples

**Names:** Use diverse, realistic names
```
✅ Sarah Chen, Marcus Johnson, Léa Dubois, Amir Patel
❌ John Doe, Jane Smith, Test User
```

**Numbers:** Use believable figures
```
✅ €47.99, 12 items, 3.2k followers
❌ €123.45, 999 items, 1,000,000 followers
```

**Dates:** Use relative when possible
```
✅ "2 hours ago", "Yesterday at 3pm", "March 15"
❌ "2024-03-15T14:32:00Z"
```

**Content:** Write real micro-copy
```
✅ "Weekly team sync - Discuss Q2 roadmap priorities"
❌ "Meeting title here"
```

---

## Microcopy Patterns

### Buttons

**Be specific about the action:**
```
❌ "Submit"
✅ "Create Account"

❌ "OK"
✅ "Got it"

❌ "Click Here"
✅ "View Details"

❌ "Next"
✅ "Continue to Payment"
```

**Destructive actions—be clear:**
```
❌ "Delete"
✅ "Delete Project"

❌ "Remove"
✅ "Remove from Team"
```

### Form Labels

**Keep labels short and clear:**
```
❌ "Please enter your email address"
✅ "Email"

❌ "Your desired password"
✅ "Password"

❌ "Input your full legal name"
✅ "Full Name"
```

**Help text goes below, not in label:**
```
Password
[________________]
At least 8 characters with one number
```

### Placeholders

**Use for examples, not labels:**
```
❌ Placeholder: "Email" (disappears when typing)
✅ Placeholder: "you@company.com"

❌ Placeholder: "Search"
✅ Placeholder: "Search projects, tasks, or people..."
```

### Empty States

**Guide, don't just describe:**
```
❌ "No data"
❌ "Nothing here"
❌ "Empty"

✅ "No projects yet—create your first one to get started"
✅ "Your inbox is empty. Nice work! 🎉"
✅ "No results for 'xyz'. Try different keywords?"
```

### Error Messages

**Formula: What happened + How to fix**
```
❌ "Error"
❌ "Invalid input"
❌ "Something went wrong"

✅ "That email is already registered. Log in instead?"
✅ "Password must be at least 8 characters"
✅ "We couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again."
```

**Never blame the user:**
```
❌ "You entered an invalid email"
✅ "This doesn't look like an email address"

❌ "You don't have permission"
✅ "This action requires admin access"
```

### Success Messages

**Confirm what happened:**
```
❌ "Success"
❌ "Done"

✅ "Project created!"
✅ "Your changes are saved"
✅ "Email sent to team@company.com"
```

### Loading States

**Tell users what's happening:**
```
❌ "Loading..."
❌ "Please wait"

✅ "Finding the best results..."
✅ "Saving your changes..."
✅ "Almost there..."
```

## Tone Calibration by Situation

### Serious Moments

**Payment, legal, security—be clear and professional:**
```
"Your payment of €49.00 was successful. 
Receipt sent to you@email.com."

"By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Service 
and Privacy Policy."

"For your security, we'll send a verification 
code to your phone."
```

### Celebratory Moments

**Achievements, completions—be warm:**
```
"You did it! 🎉 Your first project is live."

"Welcome to the team, Sarah!"

"Streak: 30 days! You're on fire 🔥"
```

### Frustrating Moments

**Errors, failures—be calm and helpful:**
```
"Hmm, that didn't work. Let's try again."

"We're having trouble connecting. 
Check your internet and retry?"

"Payment declined. Try a different card 
or contact your bank."
```

### Neutral Moments

**Instructions, forms—be clear and brief:**
```
"Enter your email to continue"

"Choose a password"

"Select your plan"
```

## Writing for Clarity

### Use Simple Words

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Utilize | Use |
| Commence | Start |
| Terminate | End |
| Subsequently | Then |
| Approximately | About |
| Functionality | Feature |
| Leverage | Use |
| Facilitate | Help |
| Aforementioned | This |

### Cut Filler Words

```
❌ "In order to save your changes, please click the button below"
✅ "Click Save"

❌ "Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
✅ "Delete this item?"

❌ "Please note that your session will expire in 5 minutes"
✅ "Session expires in 5 minutes"
```

### Front-Load Important Info

Put the key information first:

```
❌ "To reset your password, click the link we sent to your email"
✅ "Check your email for a password reset link"

❌ "If you want to cancel your subscription, go to Settings"
✅ "Cancel anytime in Settings"
```

### One Idea Per Sentence

```
❌ "Create an account to save your progress and unlock 
    premium features while also getting access to our 
    community forums and exclusive content."

✅ "Create an account to save your progress. 
    You'll also unlock premium features and community access."
```

## Consistency Rules

### Terminology

Pick one term and stick with it:

| Don't Mix | Pick One |
|-----------|----------|
| Sign in / Log in / Login | Log in |
| Sign up / Register / Create account | Sign up |
| Settings / Preferences / Options | Settings |
| Delete / Remove / Trash | Delete |
| Cancel / Abort / Stop | Cancel |

### Capitalization

**Sentence case for most UI:**
```
✅ "Create new project"
❌ "Create New Project"

✅ "Your account settings"
❌ "Your Account Settings"
```

**Title case only for:**
- Product names
- Proper nouns
- Page titles (optional, be consistent)

### Punctuation

**No periods on:**
- Button labels
- Headlines
- List items (unless full sentences)
- Placeholder text

**Yes periods on:**
- Full sentences in descriptions
- Help text
- Error messages (if full sentences)

```

"You're doing great! 💪"
"Oops! Let's try that again"
"Your friends are waiting—say hi!"
```

### E-commerce
```
Tone: Helpful, trustworthy, action-oriented

"Free returns within 30 days"
"Only 3 left at this price"
"Your order ships tomorrow"
```

"Available balance: €1,234.56"
```

## Localization Considerations

### Write for Translation

- Avoid idioms ("break a leg", "piece of cake")
- Don't embed text in images
- Leave room for expansion (German is ~30% longer than English)
- Use complete sentences (fragments translate poorly)
- Avoid culturally specific references

### Variables in Strings

```
❌ "You have " + count + " new messages"
✅ "You have {count} new messages"

❌ "Hello " + name
✅ "Hello, {name}!"
```

### Plural Forms

```
❌ "1 item(s) in cart"

✅ {count} === 1 ? "1 item in cart" : "{count} items in cart"
```
